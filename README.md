# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- <h1>CRUD Program using React Js<h1/>

<h1>
        This repository will teach you how to make a crud program using react js
      </h1>

     
<ul>
         <li>Data.jsx</li>
         <li>CreateData.jsx</li>
         <li>UpdateData.jsx</li>
         <li>DataContext.jsx</li>
       </ul>
       <h1>Data.jsx</h1>
       <p>In data.jsx component all the data of a all students will be shown</p>
       <p>if user want to add more students he can click on add button by doing this he will go to the CreateData.jsx component</p>
       <p>user can also updata or delete a single student</p>
       <p>both button update and delete are given in the last td(table date)</p>
       <h1>CreateData.jsx</h1>
       <p>in this component user can add a new student </p>
       <p>it's very simple just put all the details required</p>
       <p>and press submit button</p>
       <h1>UpdateData.jsx</h1>
       <p>in this componet we will be updating the user</p>
       <p>this could seems to be difficult because along with we will be using DataContext.jsx component to update the student</p>
       <p>for updating the student we will use useContext Hook and useReducer</p>
       <p>we have a dispatch function this dispatch funtion will check the type and according to the type it will perform action in DataContext.jsx component</p>
       <p>we will using the switch statment to check the type</p>
